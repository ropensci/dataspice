Title: Create Lightweight Schema.org Descriptions of Data
Description: The goal of dataspice is to make it easier for researchers to create basic,
   lightweight and concise metadata files for their datasets. These basic files can
   then be used to make useful information available during analysis, create a helpful
   dataset README webpage and produce more complex metadata formats to aid dataset discovery. Metadata fields are based on schema.org and other metadata standards.
